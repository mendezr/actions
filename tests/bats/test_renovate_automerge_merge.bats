# Tests for the merge-step outcome reporting in
# .github/workflows/reusable-renovate-automerge.yml ("Merge PR" step).
#
# The shell logic lives inline in the workflow YAML. It is captured here
# verbatim (MERGE_LOGIC) so any edit to the step that changes testable
# behavior must also update this file.
#
# This addresses the auto-merge issue (#403): every production run has taken
# the skip path, so the merge step has never been executed against a real PR.
# In particular the issue flags that the outcome is reported by querying
# `gh pr view --json state` rather than trusting exit codes — correct in
# principle, but untested. These tests exercise the full merge/outcome path
# against mock `gh` outputs so a regression cannot silently change merge
# behaviour (or mis-report an enqueued PR) when a real qualifying PR lands.
#
# Covers:
#   - no strategy flag is passed for merge_method=queue
#   - a squash/merge/rebase strategy produces the matching --<method> flag
#   - an invalid merge_method is rejected with a ::error:: diagnostic
#   - a successful direct merge that reports MERGED says "Merged PR #N"
#   - a successful merge that reports OPEN says "Enqueued PR #N" (merge queue)
#   - an enqueued-by-earlier-attempt ("queued to merge") result is success
#   - a merge-queue rejection of an explicit-strategy merge is retried without
#     the strategy flag, and can then succeed
#   - a stable merge failure (unrelated error) exits non-zero
#   - the advisory/exit-code are never the basis of the report: the real PR
#     state is queried afterwards
